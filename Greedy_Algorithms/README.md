# Greedy Algorithm

## Application

### Internet Routing

* Find shortest path from one site to another

* Impossible to maintain a record for websites globally

* Not practical to use the Dijkstra's algorithm

* Bellmam-Ford Algorithm (can be thought as dynamic programming)

### Sequence Alignment

* Find similarity between two strings (e.g. `AGGGCT` and `AGGCA`)

* Similarity is computed by the minimum penalty to align the sequences

* +ve penalty for each gap (inserted between characters)

* +ve penalty for each mismatch characters
